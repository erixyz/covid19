This is the python code utilized by Group 2 during the NSF internship.

We begin with the "Cleaning_Code.ipynb:

This code is simply used to get the desired data set that we will work with. 

At the end of the code, the program creates a zip file. the zip file created is the same data seen in the other py files which have the name "covid19_cleaned_8_10.zip".

>>NOTE: THIS DATASET USE BERNOULLI APPROXIMATIONS IN ORDER TO FILL IN SEX!!!
